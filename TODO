* port funnel UI classes (as3) to javascript:
    - Accelerometer
    - DCMotor
    - LED
    - RGBLED
    - SoftPot
    
* decide on file structure:
	- core + ui?
	- core + input + output?
	- core + sensors + actuators?

* create a few practical examples

* create build script

* create simple gui-based server application (in progress... will upload soon)
	- cross platform
	- easy to install
	- gui to select serial port and network port (for webserver connection)

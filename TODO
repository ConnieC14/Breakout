* finish refactoring to use Pin object rather than various arrays
	- decide on as3glue or funnel model for sending pin data

* support full Firmata 2.2 protocol
	- implement i2c spec

* finalize the event model
	
* create config file (json?) or (class?) for each Arduino board type
	- or use capabilities query to determine configuration automatically?
	
* decouple socket (so you could use web socket, flash socket via swf, or other)?

* align code to js best practices

* create simple server application
	- cross platform
	- easy to install
	- gui to select serial port and baud rate
	- supports multiple Arduino connections simultaneously?
